I started this website as a way for me to document my learning process while I attempt to teach myself about coding, data analytics, and anything else I might fancy.

My posts may be a bit scattered and inconsistent as I have a full time job, but I'll try to keep some decent post frequency going here if for no other reason than to help my own learning.  I hope the posts can help you too!
